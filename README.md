Recording and recognizing speech is implemented using SpeechRecognition and Vosk. 

The LLM of choice is Ollama (llama3).

The Text-to-Speech is implemented with gTTS.

P.S. To make Vosk work you need to download model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
and unpack in working directory as *model*
